Dataset Column Description

This dataset contains hourly air quality measurements collected using gas sensors and meteorological instruments. Each row represents air conditions recorded at a specific date and time.

📅 Temporal Columns

- Date
The date when the measurement was recorded (DD/MM/YYYY).

- Time
The time of measurement in hourly intervals (HH.MM.SS).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🌫️ Pollutant Concentrations (Ground Truth)

- CO(GT)
Ground truth concentration of Carbon Monoxide (CO) measured in mg/m³.
This pollutant is commonly used to assess air quality and was used to define air quality levels in this project.

- NMHC(GT)
Ground truth concentration of Non-Methane Hydrocarbons (NMHC) in µg/m³.

- C6H6(GT)
Ground truth concentration of Benzene (C₆H₆) in µg/m³.
Benzene is a harmful pollutant associated with traffic and industrial emissions.

- NOx(GT)
Ground truth concentration of Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) in ppb.

- NO2(GT)
Ground truth concentration of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂) in µg/m³.

🧪 Sensor Measurements

These columns represent responses from chemical sensors. They do not measure pollutants directly, but provide signals correlated with pollutant concentrations.

- PT08.S1(CO)
Sensor response related to Carbon Monoxide concentration.

- PT08.S2(NMHC)
Sensor response related to Non-Methane Hydrocarbons.

- PT08.S3(NOx)
Sensor response related to Nitrogen Oxides.

- PT08.S4(NO2)
Sensor response related to Nitrogen Dioxide.

- PT08.S5(O3)
Sensor response related to Ozone (O₃).

🌡️ Meteorological Variables

- T
Temperature in degrees Celsius (°C).

- RH
Relative Humidity expressed as a percentage (%).

- AH
Absolute Humidity expressed in g/m³.

These variables influence sensor behavior and pollutant dispersion, making them important features for modeling.
